Team Members: Gabriele Di Palma, Francesco Di Stefano, Francesco Tramontano 

### Introduction
In this project the team had to face a classification task. We were given a dataset containing different observations of NEOs ( Near-Earth Objects ), detected by NEOWISE mission. 
Te project aims at analyzing the dataset to gain insigths on the differnt asteorids near the earth. This analysis was used to identify different patterns that could be used to detect potentially hazardouse asteroids impacts.
